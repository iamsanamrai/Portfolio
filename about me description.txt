I'm a self-taught web developer living in Bangalore, India. Basically I'm from Nepal. I came to Bangolore on 2017 to complete my BCA Degree.
I'm working in TCS as a IT support engineer. Although my current job is not related to programming but I always have keen interest to be programmer.
This website is my First step to be a pragrammer, I hope you enjoy it.
